*) Ethereum Gas
    -> On the Ethereum blockchain, gas refers to the cost necessary to perform a transaction on the network.
    -> Miners set the price of gas based on supply and demand for the computational power of the network needed to process smart contracts and other transactions
    -> 10 * 3 - 6 = ?
        -> Multiplication (*) = 5 gas
        -> Subtraction (-) = 3 gas
        -> Equal to (=) = 3 gas
        -> total gas -> 5 + 3 + 3 = 11 gas

    -> Some important point to note:
        a) Any transaction that modifies the blockchain costs gas.
        a) The user that generate the transaction pays for the gas
