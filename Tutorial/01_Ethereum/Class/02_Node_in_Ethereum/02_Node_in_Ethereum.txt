*) Ethereum Node:
    -> Ethereum is a distributed network of computers running software (known as nodes) that can verify blocks and transaction data. You need an application, known as a client, on your computer to "run" a node.
    -> Types of Node:
        1) Full Node
            -> Locally store a copy of the entire blockchain
            -> Verified and validate all the block
        2) Light Node
            -> Stores only the block header. Depends on full node
            -> header is like a index/context in book
            -> For Low capacity devices which cannot afford to store the gigabytes of data
        3) Archive Node
            -> Store everything kept in the full node and build an archive of historical data
            -> Requires terabytes of disk space.
