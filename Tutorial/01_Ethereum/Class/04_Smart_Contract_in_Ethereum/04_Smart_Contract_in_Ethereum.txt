    -> For Bitcoin coding language is Bitcoin Script
        -> Not Turing Complete
    -> For Ethereum coding language is Solidity
        -> Turing Complete
    -> Each node has the following:
        a) Current State of all Smart Contracts.
        b) History of both transaction and smart contract.
