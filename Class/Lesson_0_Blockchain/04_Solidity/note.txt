-> Every time we deploy smart contract to any environment we have to pay some ether 

-> We can use different type of Environment
    a) Javascript VM
        -> for testing purposes and for not to use test net metamask ether
    b) injected Web3
        -> To connect metamask as the ether transaction
    c) Web3 Provider
        -> If we want to use our own web3 provider 

*) Deploy Smart Contract to the real network not in Javascript VM
    -> for that we have to use 'injected Web3' Environment
    -> and let's say remix ide will automatically try to connect to the metamask account and after we have connected to the metamask account we can choose our network as well
    -> like : Ethereum Mainnet, Rinkeby Test Network
    -> if we will deploy the contract then here we are making a transaction on blockchain to create contract 
    -> after we had deploy now if we will try to do transaction or to call the setter function in the smart contract case we have to again pay some ether


*) EVM
    -> All the solidity code will compile down to EVM(Ethereum Virtual Machine)
